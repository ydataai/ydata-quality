    "## A data expectations introduction\n",
    "### What are data expectations?\n",
    "Detecting inconsistencies or even errors in data can sometimes be a trivial task, but surely this is far from being the norm. Many times this task requires minucious inspection of lots of data structures or advanced domain knowledge that allows a user to confidently label any shortcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider __[Test-Driven-Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)__ (TDD) for a moment. In a TDD process, software requirements are realized into test cases before the development of the software itself. Software changes are constantly ran against these test cases in order to, hopefully, detect any sort of problem that might occur. A full software pipeline can be tested in this fashion to establish a quality assurance protocol, warrant a green light for a production push, and supporting refactorizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about data? What if you could generalize domain knowledge, and generally expected data behaviour, into the datasets you manipulate, either internally sourced or from third parties? In fact many teams already do this in one way or another, but generally resorting to ad-hoc and hard to generalize processes. Taking the lesson from TDD, if we could develop a set of verifiable tests that work just like software test cases we would also get the same benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Expectation** is the name we use for unit tests applied to data, to define an expectation about data is to develop a unit test that asserts a certain property about the data and provides an actionable output in any deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Great Expectations?\n",
    "__[Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/)__ is a Python tool for creating and running data expectations suite, allowing you to validate, profile your data, automate report creation in the form of HTML documents and store validation logs. Great Expectations offers a wide range of built-in expectations but also allows you to define custom expectations that better fit to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I leverage my Great Expectations project with YData Quality?\n",
    "It's simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Locate the validations directory of your Great Expectations project, which should be under the *uncommitted* directory. There you will find a set of folders, one for each validation run that you executed.\n",
    "2. Choose a validation run to which you would like to get more insight, and copy the path to the json file.\n",
    "3. Instantiate a DataExpectationsReporter engine and run evaluate by providing the json file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations you are all set!\n"
